# Playing with dbt

This is a playground for trying out dbt cloud.

### Project Set Up

1.  You need Docker!

2.  Set up your environment variables based on your development environment.

3.  Spin up the docker container(s)

4.  Create a new DB in AWS (in my case...) or use a docker container for dev purposes.

4.  Start working with dbt!

5.  Use dbt Cloud.


### Questions I have

- [ ] are my docker files working?  Is it worth getting the Oracle container up an running here?  Postgres is sufficient for these purposes.
